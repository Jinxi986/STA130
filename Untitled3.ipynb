    "As far as i am concerned, the one suggested by ChatGPT would be my favorite code due to its easier comprehension and less rows of code. The improved version prioritizes readability and explainability, making it more suitable for teaching and collaborative coding. Firstly, each section of the code is clearly defined with descriptive variable names and constants. Besides,each action of improved code is dsitinctly separated and escapes unnecessary try-except blocks which lead to fewer probability of failure, making it easy to explain each part of the logic without overwhelming the reader. In this case, it encourages best practices for readers by being straightforward and approachable, which is especially critical for those who may not have a strong background in programming or the Monty Hall problem."

    "Bigrams: The chatbot uses bigrams (two-word sequences) instead of relying solely on the last word. This allows for richer context when predicting the next word, enhancing the overall text generation.\n",
    "Character-Specific Models: The chatbot maintains separate Markov chains for different characters by leveraging a dataset of characters. It counts word usage specific to each character, allowing for more tailored and authentic dialogue that reflects each character's unique style and personality.\n",
    "Together, these extensions improve the chatbot's ability to generate contextually appropriate and character-specific responses.\n",

    "1). ChatGPT can generate answer to the questions so fast. Every time after click \"enter\", ChatBot starts response in seconds. However, sometimes it takes Chatbot few minutes to complete the whole anwser and I need to scrolldown to help ChatBot to continue its reply consecutively.\n",
    "2). As far as I am concerned, not only isn't it frustrating for me to interact with ChatGPT, but also I can gain a lot when aiding me to solve the problems. However, it does appear sometimes that it cannot answer the queation directly and even make it more struggling which far away from the answer I want. In this case, I need to amend my questions through augmenting specific informations or expanding detailed conditions, making ChatBot more clearly understand my question. It can be a little bit annoyed that all different inforamtions I provide can effect the solution produced by ChatGPT, but it is this feature that allow me to practice my ability to think problem explicitily, improving me a lot.\n",
    "3).To be honest, using ChatBot is exactly useful to find solutions. It save a lot of time due to its quick response and no time restriction. Whenever I have trouble, I can ask it for free. Besides, it often creates detailed reply to help me comprehend effectively. However, since it is a robot instead of a person, it cannot understand some flexible question. In other words, it probable answer the question in a hard way to understand. when I cannot comprehend what it explain and want to have a more better understanding, it may cause problem. Because it cannot perform like a teacher to translate the illustration into better understood way. "
